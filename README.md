Ouch My Ears is a lightweight mobile app built with Flutter that helps users visually understand the loudness of their environment using real-time microphone input. The app displays ambient noise levels through simple color indicatorsâ€”green for safe, yellow for caution, and red for potentially harmful volumes making it ideal for students, commuters, and live music lovers who want to protect their hearing. Designed to be fast, intuitive, and privacy-friendly, the app requires no login or data collection, focusing solely on helping users stay aware of their auditory surroundings.
